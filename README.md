# ðŸ¥” Potato Leaf Disease Detection Web App

An AI-powered web application that detects **potato leaf diseases** from images using deep learning. Built using **Python**, **TensorFlow**, and **Streamlit**, this tool helps farmers and agricultural professionals **identify diseases early** and minimize crop loss.



## ðŸ’¡ Key Features

### ðŸ”¸ User-Friendly Interface  
Built using **Streamlit**, the web app allows users to upload images of potato leaves directly from their devices with a clean and responsive UI.

### ðŸ”¸ Real-Time Disease Detection  
Once the image is uploaded, the system instantly analyzes and classifies the leaf into one of the following categories:
- **Potato___Early_blight**
- **Potato___Late_blight**
- **Potato___Healthy**

This enables **quick diagnosis** and encourages timely actions.

### ðŸ”¸ Deep Learning Powered  
The model is trained using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** in **TensorFlow** and is seamlessly integrated into the app for real-time predictions.
